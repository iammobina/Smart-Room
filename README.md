# Smart Room  

Kids are the most important part of a family that needs so much care.
In real life, you have many works to do which makes you forget to do something that you have been planned for but now in this smart room, we do something to take care of your room and house while you are busy enough to forget what you are about doing and also gives you an alert to do it yourself.

Children of every age need care appropriate to their age. For example, when the baby feels hungry and wakes up, the mother must feed him.
In essence, the room should include things like room temperature and ventilation and keeping out of danger and keeping her health and the most important of her needs.


## Design Overview

We briefly outline the items that have been implemented in this project.
1. Parents can protect the child's room if necessary and specify a password
for the door.
2. There are sensors in the room, and the first sensor is used to set the temperature,
and the parents can observe and determine the desired temperature.
3. A second sensor is used to set the proper light for the room during the day.
4. A third sensor is placed near the window and a certain sensor is lit to
warn the parents if the child approaches the window and is in danger.(we have implemented an additional feature based on word detecting!)
5. Another sensor is embedded for the needs of the child and activates
when the child is crying.
6. When a child is asleep, when it approaches the edge of the bed,
the sensor becomes active and automatically climbs onto the bed and
prevents the child from falling.
7. Another sensor for ventilation, considered in two cases to enable it to be activated,
is the first mode in which the parents turn on, and the second mode is lit up
at a certain time.
8. We consider the sensor for the moisture of the bed.

## Language
The project is written in Verilog.

This project also includes FSM Chart, ASM Chart, Hardware Design (ASIC Synthesis), and FPGA Synthesis.
